# This extra install section is only necessary if your project has already installed AMD dependencies like Dojo using
# npm, since AMD path resolution does not follow Node.js path resolution rules but npm does not know this
install:
  - travis_retry npm install
  - cd node_modules/intern
  # Chai is loaded as an AMD module but npm does not install it for the copy of Intern being used to test because
  # the same version is currently installed as a dependency for this package as well
  - travis_retry npm install chai
  - travis_retry npm install dojo
